Plugin for the scoutapp.com monitoring framework.

Reports number of matched occurrences in log content since last check.
Handles rolling log files where rolling is handled by renaming the log file
(e.g. server.log renamed to server.log.1, then resume logging to new file server.log).

Uses grep to find matching patterns.  Administrator specifies grep args in the
plugin configuration.
